        If --engine is specified, then ENGINE-NAME must be either "kvs",
        in which case the built-in engine is used, or "sled", in which
        case sled is used. If this is the first run (there is no data
        previously persisted) then the default value is "kvs"; if there
        is previously persisted data then the default is the engine already
        in use. If data was previously persisted with a different engine than
        selected, print an error and exit with a non-zero exit code.
